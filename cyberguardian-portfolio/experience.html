              As an entry-level ethical hacker, I have experience using a variety of tools and 
              technologies to identify and mitigate security risks in networks and systems. 
              Some of the tools I frequently use in my engagements include: 
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Nmap: Nmap is a powerful network exploration and security auditing tool that 
                can be used to identify hosts and services on a network, as well as discover 
                vulnerabilities and security issues. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Metasploit: Metasploit is an open-source framework that is used for developing 
                and executing exploit code against a target system. It is one of the most popular 
                tools for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Burp Suite: Burp Suite is a web application security testing tool that is used to 
                identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. It includes a variety of 
                tools for testing different aspects of web application security, including injection 
                attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and more. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Wireshark: Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that is used to capture and analyze 
                network traffic. It can be used to identify potential security threats, such as 
                unauthorized access attempts, data leaks, and more. 
              </li>
              <li>
                John the Ripper: John the Ripper is a password cracking tool that can be used to test 
                the strength of passwords in a system. It can be used to test password policies and 
                identify weak passwords that could be easily cracked by attackers. 
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              These skills are just a few examples of the many different technical and non-technical 
              skills that I have developed as an entry-level ethical hacker. I am committed to continuing 
              my professional development and staying up-to-date on the latest tools and techniques in 
              the field, and I am confident that I have the skills and expertise necessary to help organizations 
              protect their networks and systems from malicious actors.
