              Welcome to my ethical hacking portfolio! My name is Joan Çerepi, 
              and I am an entry-level ethical hacker with a passion for cybersecurity 
              and a commitment to helping organizations protect their networks and 
              systems from malicious actors. 
            </p>
            <p class="intro-para">
              My interest in ethical hacking began in 2020, when I was first introduced 
              to the world of ethical hacking. Since then, I have been dedicated to 
              learning as much as I can about this field, and have completed several 
              online courses and certifications, including the CompTIA Security+ 
              certification.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-para">
              In my previous role as a junior penetration tester, I was responsible 
              for testing the security of various computer systems from an adversarial 
              perspective. During this time, I developed a deep understanding of the 
              importance of cybersecurity and the skills necessary to identify and 
              mitigate security risks. 
            </p>
            <p class="intro-para">
              More recently, I have worked on several independent projects to further 
              develop my skills in ethical hacking. For example, I have participated 
              in several hacking challenges and CTFs, which have helped me to develop 
              my technical skills and stay up-to-date on the latest threats and 
              vulnerabilities.
