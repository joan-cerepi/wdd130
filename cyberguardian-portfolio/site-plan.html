      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Welcome to my ethical hacking portfolio! My name is Joan Çerepi, and I am an entry-level 
        ethical hacker with a passion for cybersecurity and a commitment to helping organizations 
        protect their networks and systems from malicious actors.
        <br>
        <br>
        My interest in ethical hacking began in 2020, when I was first introduced to the world of 
        ethical hacking. Since then, I have been dedicated to learning as much as I can about this 
        field, and have completed several online courses and certifications, including the CompTIA 
        Security+ certification.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my previous role as a junior penetration tester, I was responsible for testing the security
        of various computer systems from an adversarial perspective. During this time, I developed a deep 
        understanding of the importance of cybersecurity and the skills necessary to identify and mitigate 
        security risks.
        <br>
        <br>
        More recently, I have worked on several independent projects to further develop my skills in ethical 
        hacking. For example, I have participated in several hacking challenges and CTFs, which have helped me 
        to develop my technical skills and stay up-to-date on the latest threats and vulnerabilities.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, I am passionate about ethical hacking and am committed to using my skills and expertise to help 
        organizations improve their security posture. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and please feel free 
        to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my experience and skills.
