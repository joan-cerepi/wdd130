            Hello everyone! I am from the city of Korçë, Albania. If you have
            never heard of it, Albania is a small country in Europe located
            between Greece and Italy. I have a younger sister and I am currently
            <span class="age"></span> years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a convert to the church. I was baptized and confirmed a member
            of the church in December 2016. My strong love and testimony of the
            gospel gave me the desire to serve a mission. I was called to the
            Bulgaria/Central Eurasian Mission, Turkish speaking and served in
            the country of Bulgaria.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently a student in the Applied Technology program of
            BYU-Pathway. My hobbies include reading, teaching, playing video
            games, horseback riding, doing math, writing code, ethical hacking
            (penetration testing) etc. I have been into computers since I was a
            kid and the last few years I have been teaching myself how to do
            ethical hacking. My dream job is to become a web app & network
            penetration tester. Finding vulnerabilities and security bugs in
            code feels like a game to me and I love the idea of helping make the
            Internet a safer place. Some of the coding languages I have had
            exposure to are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Php, SQL, Go, C++,
            Java.
